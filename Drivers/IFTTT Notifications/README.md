# What does it do?

This is a Hubitat driver that will deliver notifications via an [IFTTT Webhook](https://ifttt.com/maker_webhooks). It's a slightly modified version of mlritchie's [Twilio Notifications Driver](https://community.hubitat.com/t/twilio-notifications-driver/1676).

# How to use

* Install the Hubitat driver and enter your credentials (get your IFTTT Webhooks API key [here](https://ifttt.com/services/maker_webhooks/settings)
* Install the IFTTT Android or iOS app.
